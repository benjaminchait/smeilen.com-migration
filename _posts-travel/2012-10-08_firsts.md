This week marks the end of my professional life for a time. This job included many firsts: first 9-5 where it was really more like an 7-6, first promotion, first managerial experience. Despite the frustrations faced, the people with whom I worked—colleagues and patients alike—taught me more in in the past year than most of the previous twenty.

Coming from an EMS background, this first opportunity in a clinic revealed the benefits of following patients over the course of treatments, of forming relationships, or simply patients being conscious. Inevitably days began with a demanding, difficult or daunting first patient and recovering seemed impossible with a fully booked schedule. Without fail soon would follow a patient equally as content to sit and wait as long as necessary and express gratitude for quick conversations or simple treatments. I will return to medicine for these people; my upcoming trip serves merely as an intermission.</p> <figure style="width: 1600px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
