Today marks three years. Three years of challenges, exploration, friendship, affection. Not every day is easy, many far from it. Be it connecting from 1,700 miles apart, deciding the next step (in life and with each other) or surviving the wide varieties of trials inherent in world travel, we have never chosen the simple path.

And yet, you make me talk even when it&#8217;s painful. You listen even when it&#8217;s irrational.

You coax laughter from tears and calm from frustration.

You love me at my worst and celebrate me at my best.

You are the only person I want to share in these times and travels.

All I ask is that we continue to grow, laugh and challenge the world.

Love, as always.
