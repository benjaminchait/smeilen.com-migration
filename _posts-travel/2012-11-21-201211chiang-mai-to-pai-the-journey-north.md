  <span class="s1">Northern Thailand is Bangkok&#8217;s artsy cousin. Small shops run by local artist pepper the streets. Despite both northern towns relying largely on tourism as the main source for income, they lack Bangkok&#8217;s overwhelming and obvious effort. It is possible to walk down entire city blocks without someone trying to scam, sell or swindle. This simple difference makes the north a calm retreat from chaos.&nbsp;</span>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The northbound trip revealed the famously-rumored difficulties of overland travel. The venture to Chiang Mai, the former capital, involved a 12-hour train ride. True to the warnings of our host, it arrived after 17 hours, a good portion of which we spent in reverse to the (relatively) nearest station to switch engines.&nbsp;</span>

  <span class="s1">Chiang Mai has a laid-back, west coast vibe to Bangkok&#8217;s insanity. Our hostel sat just outside the southern wall and came complete with a yard, a garden and banana trees. Leisurely breakfasts often stretched through late morning. Days were spent exploring cafes, art galleries and <a href="/travel/2012/11/tigers" data-link-type="external">Tiger Kingdom</a>. We procured dinners from numerous local vendors. Red chili peppers provide northern dishes with a distinct kick.</span>

From there we continued northward to the small backpacking town of Pai. As is printed on every sign, t-shirt and postcard, the 3-hour journey involves no fewer than 762 turns through the mountains. The induced nausea is well-worth it as the town is truly an idyllic spot nestled into a river valley, just shy of the Myanmar border.&nbsp;Two main streets are lined with small guesthouses doubling as restaurants. It was easy to eat at a new place for every meal. Both streets become a walking market in the evenings where everything from delicious street food to local art can be acquired. The five days spent there proved a welcome respite from the mounting exhaustion from travel and culture shock.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
