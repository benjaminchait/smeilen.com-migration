Thousands of miles from home I am challenging notions of the world and of my self. A short drive from our father&#8217;s house, my brother is on an equally trying and revealing endeavor, one striving for health and self awareness.&nbsp;There is no short or easy path to understanding and nothing truly instructive is comfortable. But from these&nbsp;journeys&nbsp;come the experiences that define us and we emerge as more realized versions of ourselves.&nbsp;

Joe, this is but one of many journeys that will fill your life. &nbsp;I love you always.&nbsp;
