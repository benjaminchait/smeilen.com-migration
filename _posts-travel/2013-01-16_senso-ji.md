Senso-ji&#8217;s grounds contain two starkly different worlds. The first is apparent upon stepping out of the subway station, the chaos of far too many people in far too small a space. Snaking through the market, jostling for a whiff of incense, staking a piece of ground for a picture; it is pointless to fight the strong current of people.</p>

But turning the camera upwards brings into focus a different perspective, the calm serenity of a temple. Above the waves of the crowded ground exists an echo of a time before tourists and cameras, of monks and services.&nbsp;

This is Tokyo: a churning present coursing through pockets of quiet history.
