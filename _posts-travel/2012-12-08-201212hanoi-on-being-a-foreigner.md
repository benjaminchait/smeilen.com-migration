  <span class="s1">Despite it&#8217;s multicultural heritage, never has a city made me feel more foreign than Hanoi. Since reunification, Hanoi has served as the capital of Vietnam; however at various times it acted as the seat of power for Chinese and French occupations. These power transfers are evident in the lingering varieties of architecture. Chinese temples are sprinkled throughout the city. The Temple of Literature, though it is a Confucian school, preserves architectural styles from several different Vietnamese dynasties. Centered in the French Quarter towers a reconstruction of the Paris Opera House yet downtown houses memorials to Ho Chi Minh built in an almost Washington DC-style with definitive Vietnamese flair.&nbsp;</span>

  <span class="s1">With all this varied heritage you would imagine Western tourists would not be a novelty. Throughout the rest of Vietnam being Caucasian marked you as a tourist, someone with money, in Hanoi it simply seems to give you status. Often it is young Vietnamese openly staring, flattering, if not slightly disconcerting. However on more than one occasion people stop whatever they are photographing, tourist sites or wedding, to turn their cameras toward me. This provides Benjamin with endless amusement; as for me, I do not ever want to be famous.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

Nevertheless, our journeys through the differing quarters and small corners of the city proved entertaining and educational. Unlike Saigon, which is very much the economic center of the country, Hanoi is a DC-like capital with large parks and ponds, embassies and memorials.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
