Bangkok&#8217;s urban sprawl was immediately evident as we rode the tangled expressways into downtown. The disregard for driving laws—more accurately described as suggestions—characterized movement through downtown. When met with a long line of cars, our cab driver nonchalantly pulled across the road and drove against the flow of scooters. Recovering from this initial onslaught, we set out to explore the overwhelming central shopping district. Any and all fears that we would not be able to purchase anything needed or desired quelled. Mall after mall interspersed with street vendors stretched in all directions. The elevated pedestrian walkways gave a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the chaotic traffic flow. As stoplights changed to red, scooters streamed forward through the columns of traffic to form a dense pack ahead of the waiting cars and tuk-tuks. Needless to say, there was a touch of sensory overload.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The following day we dubbed &#8220;Buddha Day 1&#8221;. We began at the Royal Palace and Wat Phra Kaew, or Temple of the Emerald Buddha. In contrast with the urban scenes of the day before, opulence was prevalent. The temple serves as the king&#8217;s personal place of worship and the grounds reflect. Reminiscent of Versailles, gold and brilliant colors abound, coating architecture and images alike.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Approaching the main temple, we removed our shoes and received stern warnings to not point our feet toward Buddha while sitting. Enthroned atop a tower of gold, the Emerald Buddha sat cross legged clad in his rainy-season attire—it is changed seasonally. Venturing through the palace grounds confirmed Thailand as a country of elephants and it became a personal mission to document all we encountered.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

After a brief, delicious street lunch we continued on to Wat Po, Temple of the Reclining Buddha. Somewhat less opulent, the surrounding grounds were no less stunning than the palace.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The Reclining Buddha is one of the largest images at a whopping 43 meters long and 15 meters high. While it lacks the subtle beauty of the considerably smaller Emerald Buddha, it is nonetheless astounding.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The subsequent days were a bit of a blur of further exploration and a continuing battle against jet lag and creeping culture shock. Meandering through various districts of downtown we explored the backpacker haven of Khaosan Road—where we stayed—the bustling Chinatown and scattered parks. All said, Bangkok was an experience but we were ready to adjourn to the quieter Chiang Mai.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

A final thank you to Amy Wimberger&#8217;s wonderful household for all the advice and hosting us through the initial shock and haze of trans-Pacific travel.
