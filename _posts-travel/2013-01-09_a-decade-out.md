Today is one to commemorate many events. Today you turned 50, Mom. But more than getting older this is a day to celebrate a decade that was not promised to us. You have survived so much and to this day you are my inspiration, my strength and my reassurance. We may not be in the same place but we can still love and celebrate together. I love you, Mom. Happy Birthday. Happy 10 years.&nbsp;</p>
