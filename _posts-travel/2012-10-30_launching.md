Our adventure began with no small amount of trepidation and a lot of sitting. We started with the quick hop from Denver to Seattle. The 39-hour journey made much more bearable by including a 16-hour layover in the Emerald City with good friends. From there we launched the long fight across the Pacific, or more accurately, the Arctic. Though surprisingly little ocean, we did see Alaskan mountains, Arctic ice sheets and Mongolian steppes. Navigating Beijing&#8217;s International Terminal proved more difficult than anticipated when facing both incoming and outgoing immigration, customs and security despite having only a three-hour layover. The final flight seemed to be over in a moment in comparison—and the haze—of nearly a day and a half of travel. Arriving in Bangkok, we breezed through immigration and customs, managed to convey an address to a Thai cab driver and by 2 am local we collapsed in a bed at a friend&#8217;s house.&nbsp;

Today was recuperation and minor exploration around our friend&#8217;s neighborhood. Even here in a small, distant Bangkok suburb we found a Starbucks for morning coffee. Reveling in the freedom of no schedule or responsibility we pursued the local market, wandered around the lake and marveled at the degree of Westernization. We wound the day down with a delicious, home-cooked, Thai dinner and a movie night.&nbsp;

Next stop: Downtown Bangkok.
