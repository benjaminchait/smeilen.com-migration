<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">The sole visitors to a seaside cafe, we shared a moment with a young Vietnamese family. Tucked among the remnants of Ha Long City&#8217;s abandoned hotels, we sat with the cafe owners and their four-year-old son named Minh.</span>
</p>

<p class="p1">
  <span class="s1">With broken English we traded words for familial relations, foods and crab, one of which the father had just caught—still alive—for his son. Holding one end of a string attached to the crab, the little boy commenced a gleeful dance tinged with slight fear whenever the small crustacean scuttled too close. Pulling pictures from my journal I relayed stories of my own dogs, relating them to the family&#8217;s newly acquired pet. I explained pictures of my own brothers, sisters and parents to Minh, gesturing to his to help him understand.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

A hemisphere away, separated by languages that shared few—if any—common words, this small family and I have common experiences. Parents who love but gently encourage daunting activities. Delight stemming from interactions with animals. These small moments are communicated regardless of barriers and remind that no matter how far from home, families and love exist everywhere.<figure style="width: 2500px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
